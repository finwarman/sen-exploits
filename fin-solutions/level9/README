run `./exploit`

Level 9 can be completed by writing to memory using the vulnerable 'mystrcat' function.

Observations about the input:

- Powers of 2 as the input radix let us provide an input that would usually be considered to exceed the max value. This avoids the message `overflow detected, argument too large`. This allows us to overflow the buffer.

- We can write arbitrary bytes into the environment variable, `SEPARATOR`.

Using the address of our shellcode in the environment, e.g. `0xbffffcd9`, we can overwrite the return address of main to our shellcode address, thus triggering `l33t` and advancing to the next level.
In order to do this, we first overflow the buffer so that the address used by 'mystrcat' points to an environment variable of a known address, in this case the env var 'TARGET', set by modifying the SEPARATOR variable. Then, the data at the pointer we provided is written past the end of the buffer, overwriting main's return address. We fill 'TARGET' with the pointer to our shellcode env var, 'LEET' which gets executed instead of main returning.

`find_env.bin` can be used to find address of environment vars, e.g. `../find_env LEET`
