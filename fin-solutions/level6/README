run `./exploit`

Level 6 requires providing an index with each character for the input. Using Python list comprehension,
we can enumerate each value in the input to provide a consecutive offset.
Through some investigation, we can see the the start of the array (e.g. writing A0), places a value 28 bytes before
the return address. We craft the first part of our input to overwrite this return address, and the second part to
place a shell-code in the buffer. The return address is overwritten to jump to the shell-code in the buffer.
(The address used in this case is 0xffffda3c, or "\x3c\xda\xff\xff" in hex-encoded little-endian. It lands in the NOP sled of the shell-code provided in ./level6/exploit)
