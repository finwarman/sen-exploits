run `./exploit`

Level 7 is solved with a buffer overflow exploit. We have a buffer 'result', of size 256, that is populated with
three arguments from argv. For the first argument, we provide the shell-code, padded with a NOP sled (0x90), so
that we have our shell-code in the buffer. Then, we provide some further padding in the second argument, and the
start of the third. Finally, having overflow the buffer, we write our desired return address back to the NOP sled of our shell-code in the buffer which executes our shell-code instead of returning from main, bringing us to the next level.
